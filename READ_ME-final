Hello and welcome to our Chocan simulator;

We have included a makefile plus all of the required files to run the simulator.
Including sample CSV files.
 
Make includes make (all) and make clean, as well as others.
 
As a general rule anything that requires an id will accept either the correct
number of 0's or a count-up. (ie: 000000000 or 123456789) and find relevant info.
On the other hand all 5's (ie: 555555555 or 555555) is specifically not included
in the sample data sets to allow 'good' entry with no result testing.

The CSV files have been set to read-in from one file and write-out to another, 
for testing purposes to all easy comparision of the two.  The titles can be found
as macros in the chocan.hpp file. 

For testing purposes, a directory is included labeled Testing. It contains the 
testing files which are set up to link up one level to this directory.  
In it are already compiled testing program modules for the seperate modules of the simulator.
### If I get around to writing a make for them it might not but 1st things 1st. ###
Each can be run on it's own or their is also an included bash scripts which
can be used to run various test sets.

As an added bonus just for fun there is a directory containing a small program used
to generate test data for the different people groups.

We hope you enjoy it, while it's a small program we worked hard to capture the
true essence of what it is meant to repersent.
