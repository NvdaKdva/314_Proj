Hello & Welcome;

I'm glad you're here, I recomment setting up repository in your ~ dir by:

This command will create a directory names 314_Proj, go to the directory you would like this directory located in.
 Mine is in my home (~) directory
cd as needed into that directory and clone the repository using the following command
  "git clone https://github.com/NvdaKdva/314_Proj.git"
It will ask you for a username enter: "NvdaKdva" 
It will ask you for a password enter: "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"
 {NOTE: It will not display the password and it's long strongly recommend copy and paste
 FYI - It will ask you for this everytime you push or pull, since it's a token and not
 a real password it can't be changed.  If you want to set up an ssh key let me know.}

now type git remote -v (view) and you should see 
origin  https://github.com/NvdaKdva/314_Proj.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/NvdaKdva/314_Proj.git (push)
Congrats!

!! VERY IMPORTANT !!
DO NOT MERGE TO MASTER WITH OUT MERGE MANAGER APPROVAL.
If you REEAAALLYYY need to see how a merge would affect the larger project then 
-> commit or stash your branch
-> make a new branch FROM MASTER called "<x> merge test" or simular
-> test your merge there.  
In fact I generally recommend doing it that way in general and making notes on conflict resolutions.
Then after seeing that they work. Bomb it out and repeat in Master.

Have a great day.
