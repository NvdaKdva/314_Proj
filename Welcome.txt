Hello & Welcome;

I'm glad you're here, I recomment setting up remote repository in your ~ dir by:

< instructins here>

!! VERY IMPORTANT !!
DO NOT MERGE TO MASTER WITH OUT MERGE MANAGER APPROVAL.
If you REEAAALLYYY need to see how a merge would affect the larger project then 
-> commit or stash your branch
-> make a new branch FROM MASTER called "<x> merge test" or simular
-> test your merge there.  
In fact I generally recommend doing it that way in general and making notes on conflict resolutions.
Then after seeing that they work. Bomb it out and repeat in Master.
